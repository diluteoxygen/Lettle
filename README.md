A really bad Python based wordle "clone", if you could even call it that lol. (trust me its bad)


## Requirements

Everything is ran through CLI by default, so you only need Python installed.

## Features

- Compact and runs locally
- Supports custom wordlist
- Really bad


## Run Locally [Default]

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/diluteoxygen/Lettle.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Lettle
```

Run Lettle.py

```bash
  python Lettle.py
```




## Run Locally with Custom Wordlist

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/diluteoxygen/Lettle.git
```

Go to the project directory, delete default wordlist and replace with your wordlist.
(Make sure to rename it to words.txt)

```bash
  cd Lettle
```
If your wordlist has each word separated by a space or any other delimiter, Navigate to converter.py and repace your separator in the marked section and run the following command.

```bash
  python Convert.py
```
Finally, run the following to load the custom wordlist into Lettle
```bash
  python Lettle.py
```
